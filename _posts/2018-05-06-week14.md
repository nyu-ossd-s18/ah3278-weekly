## Reflection

#### What you learned?
I learned a lot about Open Source and how to contribute to it. It was very interesting as I didn't really have knowledge about Open Source prior to the class. Contributing to a project gave me a greater appreciation for Open Source. I was able to communicate with the community, open issues, comment, and make pull requests. 

#### What you wished you had learned?
I wish I had learned more about available Open Source projects. While we did learn about RedHat, Mozilla, and Google Open Source, it would have been nice to know about other projects that were less known but are still highly popular Open Source projects that others can contribute to. 

#### If you could remove one thing, what would it be?
I would remove the bash scripting lecture. It was cool to know about, but I didn't think it did much in terms of the class.  

#### If you could add one thing to the course, what would it be?
I would add a lecture on summaries of Open Source projects that have plenty of easy first issues. It was a struggle trying to find good Open Source projects to contribute to. Having a list of good Open Source projects would have been nice as people could focus more on contributing to projects rather than trying to find a project to contribute to. It really sucked when a project had to be switched because it was too hard to do and more time is wasted trying to find another project.
