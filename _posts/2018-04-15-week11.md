## Project Progress
Our group held another informal meeting in addition to our normal meeting times to catch up on work. In particular, I was looking at the code so that I could implement damage to the characters using the snow block. The code base was rather large and it took a while to understand what was happening. 

## Contributions
I commented on issue [17106](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17106) and commented on issue [17095](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17095) by reproducing the issue.
