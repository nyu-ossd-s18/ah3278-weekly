## Project Progress
Our group held another informal meeting in addition to our normal meeting times to catch up on work. In particular, I was looking at the source code so that I could implement damage to the characters using the snow block. The issue was to have the snow block break under the character's weight. The code base was rather large and it took a while to understand how things related in the code. There is a lot of trial and error because the code hasn't been implemented before so I have to look for all the necessary files that I need to change. 

## Contributions
I commented on issue [17106](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17106) and commented on issue [17095](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17095) by reproducing the issue.
